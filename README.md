# Algorithms & Data Structures

I have multiple repositories, in different programming languages, dedicated to 
the study of algorithms and data structures. These repositories serve as a 
practice ground for the language itself, its toolchain (unit testing, 
documentation, etc), and version control. They also contain solutions for 
problems like the ones found in Project Euler.

In general, these repos are where I practice programming languages a little more
formally, and here is where I collect all of them for our convenience.

Please feel free to contribute in any way! All repos are always open for code reviews,
pull requests, issues, and discussions.
